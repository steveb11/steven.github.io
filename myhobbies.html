        <h1>What I like to do!</h1>

 <p><IMG SRC="goalie.jpg"></p>

<P> I love playing hockey. I've been playing hockey since I was 8 years old. I played for both Lynnfield youth and select teams. Over the course of playing, I've met so many friends I still have today. I was once a defenseman in hockey, I loved to block shots and help stop goals. Around age 13, my team's goalie got hurt and I volunteered to play. I've been a goalie ever since. I love the equipment and making big saves. It's such a thrill! </P>

<P> A new hobby of mine, if you'd consider it a hobby, is pledging at a fraternity here at UMaine. The fraternity I'm associated with is called Phi Kappa Sigma. I love this new aspect of my social life because I love the great group of guys there, as well as the stuff we do for the community. Through Phi Kappa Sigma, I've learned so much about philantrophy and community and I just love the feeling I get from helping our community, especially with such a great array of kids just like me. </P>

<p> Lastly, I'd say my favorite hobby is traveling. My mom and dad have shown me so much of this world through travel and I couldn't be more greatful. While there is still tons and tons more for me to see, my favorite vacations include trips to Ireland, Iceland, and Utah. The picture above is actually from Horseshoe Bend in Page, Arizona. We have such a beautiful Earth God blessed us with and I just love to see as much as I can. </p>
