<body> My mom and dad are my favorite people in the world. As well as my sister, I guess. My mom is from Nashua, NH and my dad from Peabody, MA. My mom works in admissions at North Shore Community College in Lynn, MA while my father works at his former high school, Peabody High School, as a US History teacher. These two inspire me so much. In fact, next semester I'm dropping out of business and hoping to pursue an education major to be a history teacher like my dad. I love my mom and dad so much. They are without a doubt the greatest parents you could get and they are my best friends! </body>

<h3> Lindsey, My Sister </h3>

<body> My sister, Lindsey Elizabeth Barrett, is 22 years old and goes to UMass Amherst and is hoping to be a lawyer. Lindsey is currently studying abroad in Thailand and is traveling all over Southeast Asia, and it looks like she's having a blast doing so. Lindsey and I have a great, fantastic relationship, but when we're together for too long it gets ugly. However, at the end of the day we always love each other and literally in the middle of a huge argument we will both find something to laugh about and make up over. We truly do love each other even though it doesn't always show. </body>
